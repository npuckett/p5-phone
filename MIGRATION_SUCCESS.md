## Next Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (REQUIRED)

**Go to:** https://github.com/npuckett/p5-phone/settings/pages

**Settings:**
- Source: **Deploy from a branch**
- Branch: **main**
- Folder: **/ (root)**
- Click **Save**

**After 2-5 minutes, your site will be live at:**
https://npuckett.github.io/p5-phone/

---

### 2. Verify GitHub Pages Deployment

Wait a few minutes, then check:

```bash
# Check deployment status
open https://github.com/npuckett/p5-phone/actions

# Test homepage (once deployed)
open https://npuckett.github.io/p5-phone/examples/homepage/

# Test README renders correctly
open https://github.com/npuckett/p5-phone
```

---

### 3. (Optional) Publish New Version to npm

If you want to update npm with the new repository metadata:

```bash
cd /Users/npmac/Documents/GitHub/p5-phone

# Bump patch version (1.4.4 â†’ 1.4.5)
npm version patch

# Publish to npm
npm publish

# Push the new tag
git push --tags
```

**Or keep v1.4.4:**
The current npm package already works with CDN, so this is optional.
