## üìã Step-by-Step Migration

### 1. Copy Files to New Repository

You mentioned you've already created and cloned the new repo. Now copy all files:

```bash
# Navigate to the NEW repository location
cd /path/to/p5-phone  # Your new cloned repo

# Copy all files from THIS directory to the new repo
# (Replace /Users/npmac/Documents/GitHub/mobile-p5-permissions with current path)
cp -r /Users/npmac/Documents/GitHub/mobile-p5-permissions/* .

# Copy hidden files too
cp -r /Users/npmac/Documents/GitHub/mobile-p5-permissions/.* . 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 2. Verify Files Were Copied

```bash
# Check that key files are present
ls -la

# Should see:
# - package.json
# - p5-phone.yaml
# - src/
# - dist/
# - examples/
# - README.md
# - LICENSE
# - etc.
```

### 3. Stage and Commit All Files

```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "Initial commit: p5-phone library v1.4.4

Simplified mobile hardware access for p5.js
- Sensor access (accelerometer, gyroscope, orientation)
- Microphone integration
- Touch utilities
- Browser gesture management

Migrated from DigitalFuturesOCADU/mobile-p5-permissions"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to: https://github.com/npuckett/p5-phone/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Select branch: **main**
4. Select folder: **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**

After a few minutes, your examples will be live at:
https://npuckett.github.io/p5-phone/

### 5. Verify Everything Works

**Check GitHub Pages:**
```bash
# Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy, then test:
open https://npuckett.github.io/p5-phone/examples/homepage/
```

**Check Repository:**
- README renders correctly: https://github.com/npuckett/p5-phone
- Examples link works in README
- Issues page exists: https://github.com/npuckett/p5-phone/issues

## üöÄ Next Steps: Publishing

### Option 1: Publish as Patch Version (Recommended)

Since this is just a repository URL change, publish as a patch:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the NEW repository
cd /path/to/p5-phone

# Verify package.json has correct repo URL
cat package.json | grep "npuckett"

# Bump to 1.4.5 and publish
npm version patch
npm publish
```

This will:
- Create version 1.4.5
- Create a git tag
- Publish to npm
- Push tag to GitHub

### Option 2: Keep Same Version

If you want to keep v1.4.4 but update the metadata:

```bash
# Publish without version bump
npm publish --force

# Note: This will update the npm page but keep version 1.4.4
# The new repository URLs will show on npmjs.com
```

### After Publishing

Update the CDN links in your documentation if needed (though JSDelivr will automatically serve from npm, regardless of GitHub repo location).

## üìù Update p5.js Submission

Since you'll be submitting to p5.js, you'll use the files from the NEW repository:

**Files to submit:**
1. `p5-phone.yaml` - Already updated with new URLs ‚úÖ
2. `P5Phone.png` - No changes needed ‚úÖ

**Submission checklist:**
- [x] YAML points to `https://github.com/npuckett/p5-phone`
- [x] websiteUrl points to `https://npuckett.github.io/p5-phone/`
- [x] npm package is published
- [x] GitHub Pages is enabled
- [ ] Wait for GitHub Pages to finish deploying
- [ ] Test live examples work
- [ ] Submit to p5.js-website repository

## üîÑ Old Repository Cleanup (Optional)

Once everything is working in the new location:

### Option 1: Archive the Old Repo
1. Go to: https://github.com/DigitalFuturesOCADU/mobile-p5-permissions/settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Archive this repository"
4. Add message: "Project moved to https://github.com/npuckett/p5-phone"

### Option 2: Add Redirect README
Create a simple README in the old repo pointing to the new one:

```markdown
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Repository Moved

This repository has been moved to:

## üëâ [npuckett/p5-phone](https://github.com/npuckett/p5-phone)

Please use the new repository for:
- Latest code and updates
- Issues and discussions
- Documentation

The npm package is now published from the new repository.
```
